# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). This is the default behavior.

When you use `echo: true` you will show both the code and the output.

```{python}
#| echo: true
print("Hello")
```

# Using figures and equations

Using `fig-cap` allows you to specifiy a caption for a figure. Use it in code blocks where the last line prints a plot.

```{python}
#| fig-cap: Radial plot
#| label: fig-radial
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

You can write Latex equiations:

$$
E=mc^2
$$

If the label attribute of a code chunk starts with `fig-` when it renders a  plot, you can reference it. For example, here we reference @fig-radial.

Be attentive as some things might need manual tweaking.

# Using other formating

Multiple formatting options

1. You can use lists
1. They will numerate by themselves
1. No need to worry about counting

You are not restricted to numbered lists.

- first
- second
- third

## Use of sub headers

Organize your document as you please. How much organization do you really need?

## Another subheader

Does this looks nice to you? This document follows Markdown conventions.

### A deeper level

However, is best that you don't go too deep because lower levels might not be fully supported in this template.

# Citations

You can add citationsfor something some said at some point. Your references should be inside the `references.bib` file. Some people might have already researched this field [see @misc_online_news_popularity_332, pp. 1-2].
